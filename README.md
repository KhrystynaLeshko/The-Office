For you to win this game - it’s just a matter of time.
Could be one month, could be two months.

Three months?
Could be.

Four months?
I can see that happening, yes.

Eight months?
That’s a realistic time line.

Eleven months?
Perhaps.

Okay now really think hard about this one: One year?
I can see that as a very real possibility.

Four hundred and ninety-four months?
I can see that happening.
